# file_soap

If you've just finished a coding project, but you're not sure whether or not you removed any obscene words you may have used during development, this is a script for you. 

Simply download `file_soap.py` and create a text file `word_list.txt` containing any words you want to make sure you're aware of. This script searches for words in both paths and in text files. 
+ If a word is found in a file, the word, path to the file, and line number are printed to the console. 
+ If a word is found in a path, the word and the path are printed to the console.

To search your files, just call 
```
python3 file_soap.py
```

For a list of words you might want to avoid publishing in your code, see
